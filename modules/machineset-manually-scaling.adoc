= Scaling a MachineSet manually

If you need to add or remove an instance of a machine in a MachineSet, you can
manually scale the MachineSet.

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster and the `oc` command line.
* Log into `oc` as a user with <some permission>.

. View the MachineSets that are in the cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The MachineSets are listed in the form of `<clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>`.

. Scale the MachineSet:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -nopenshift-machine-api
----
Or:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc edit <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
You can scale the MachineSet up or down. It takes several minutes for the new
machines to be available.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The default installation creates only one router. If you scale down your cluster,
the node that hosts the router pod might be removed. In this case, you temporarily
cannot access the web console and some other resources. After the router pod
is redeployed to a different node, service will be restored.

You can check the status of the router pod by running:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pod -n openshift-ingress
----

If there is no router pod, or if it is in the `ContainerCreating` state, wait
a little longer.
